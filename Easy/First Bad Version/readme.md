You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n versions [1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

__Constraints:__
- 1 <= bad <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
  
### Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, n
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```
