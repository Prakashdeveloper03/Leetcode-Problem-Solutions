You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

__Constraints:__
- 0 <= s.length <= 1000
- t.length == s.length + 1
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
  
### Solution
```py
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        return next(iter(Counter(t) - Counter(s)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tc = int(input())
    for _ in range(tc):
        s = input()
        t = input()
        print(Solution().findTheDifference(s, t))
```
